# LaMiracle

LaMiracle a program used to find lyrics for songs. By typing in a song name and the artist's name, a person will be able to get the lyrics. This program was made during a 36 hour hackathon called BitCamp by John Luo, Amanuel Awoke, Issac Dunbar, and Ferzam Mohammad. Our original goal was to use a microphone to pickup the music to automatically find the track and artist name and to pull up the Lyrics but we bit off more than we could chew. This was the work of our very first hackathon project.
